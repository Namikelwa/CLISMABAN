This repository will contain everything on Climate Smart Banana Project.
## Firstly the Banana tasting survey data analysis.
The Banana tasting survey has 6 different varieties of banana (Line 1 to Line 6).
We are analysing the data to understand the preffered banana variety in terms of appearance,smell and taste of different forms of banana preparation.
We have Boiled,Mashed,Fried and Stewed Banana.
